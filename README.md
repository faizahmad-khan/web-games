## 💡 Pro Tips & Strategies

1. **Spread Your Pieces** - Don't keep all pieces together, spread them for better chances
2. **Use Safe Zones** - Plan moves to land on star positions when opponents are nearby
3. **Capture Wisely** - Sometimes it's better to advance than to capture
4. **Block Opponents** - Position pieces strategically to block opponent movements
5. **Home Stretch Timing** - Enter home stretch when you have pieces trailing for support
6. **Save a Piece** - Keep one piece near opponents' starting area for capturing
7. **6 Strategy** - Use extra turns from rolling 6 to unlock multiple pieces or advance one piece rapidly
