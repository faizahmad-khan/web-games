# 🎓 Advanced Strategies & Tips

## Beginner Tips (Score: 50-150)

### Master the Basics
1. **Start Slow**: Take your time in early levels to understand game mechanics
2. **Plan Routes**: Think 2-3 moves ahead before turning
3. **Avoid Walls Early**: Corners are tricky - stay in the middle initially
4. **Vertical vs Horizontal**: Practice moving smoothly in both directions
5. **Get Comfortable**: Play for 5-10 minutes to warm up

### Control Mastery
1. **Use Arrow Keys**: More responsive than WASD for some keyboards
2. **Quick Reflexes**: Press keys decisively, not slowly
3. **Anticipate Changes**: Predict food spawns and plan accordingly
4. **Smooth Turns**: Avoid sudden 90-degree turns when possible
5. **Space Management**: Keep worm centered to maximize maneuverability

### Scoring Basics
1. **Regular Food Focus**: Consistently collect red food first
2. **Early Level Advantage**: Easier to rack up points at lower speeds
3. **Combo Momentum**: Build length early for better control later
4. **Safe Strategies**: Prioritize survival over aggressive plays

## Intermediate Tips (Score: 150-500)

### Strategic Food Collection
1. **Food Prediction**: Learn food spawn patterns
2. **Route Planning**: Create efficient paths to collect food
3. **Angle Approach**: Approach food from multiple angles
4. **Spacing**: Keep 3-4 segments distance from walls

### Body Management
1. **Tail Following**: Keep head close to tail initially
2. **Spiral Formation**: Create spirals for compact maneuvering
3. **Length Awareness**: Adjust speed expectations with longer worms
4. **Corner Avoidance**: Use body as guide instead of walls

### Difficulty Scaling
1. **Adapt to Speed**: Each level feels 10% faster
2. **Level 5 Checkpoint**: Game significantly speeds up
3. **Reflexes Needed**: Faster input required from Level 7+
4. **Speed Capping**: Game caps at 50ms per tick

### Bonus Food Introduction
1. **Spot Recognition**: Look for golden stars ⭐
2. **First Collection**: Try collecting one bonus for feel
3. **Score Boost**: Understand 5x multiplier benefit

### Bonus Food Mastery

#### When to Hunt Bonus Food
- ✅ When worm is short (3-8 segments)
- ✅ When you have space to maneuver
- ✅ When bonus appears in safe zone
- ❌ Don't hunt if close to walls
- ❌ Avoid when worm length > 15 segments

#### Strategic Bonus Timing
1. **Plan Trajectory**: Predict 2-3 moves before committing
2. **Safe Spawn Zones**: Know predictable spawn areas
3. **Time Slow Strategy**: Use the 5-second window wisely
4. **Score Windows**: High-level bonus = massive points

### Time-Slow Power-Up Optimization

#### What NOT to Do During Time-Slow
- ❌ Keep frantic speed
- ❌ Rush into tight spaces
- ❌ Ignore upcoming corners
- ❌ Stop moving completely

#### Optimal Time-Slow Usage
1. **Collect Before Danger**: Use when approaching difficult situation
2. **Chain Collection**: Collect 2-3 regular foods during slow
3. **Navigate Maze**: Perfect for tight corner navigation
4. **Recover Position**: Reposition for better angle
5. **Distance Creation**: Create separation from body

#### Time-Slow Tactics
```
Example: Worm length = 12, Speed = Level 4

Scenario 1: Food at tight corner
- Use time-slow to safely navigate
- Collect 2-3 additional foods
- Score: 40 + 50×4 + 40 + 40 = 240 points

Scenario 2: Bonus available + Regular food nearby
- Ignore bonus, collect regular foods
- Build length and spacing
- Grab bonus when conditions safer
- Maximize total score per slow window
```

### Advanced Maneuvering

#### The Spiral Technique
1. Create concentric spirals as worm grows
2. Enter from outer ring, exit from inner
3. Safe zones created by body pattern
4. Excellent for collecting clustered food
5. Requires practice and precision

#### The Chase Technique
1. Follow your tail loosely
2. Create curved paths vs sharp angles
3. Leave space for emergency maneuvers
4. Works well with steady speeds
5. Reduces collision risks

#### The Corner Bounce
1. Approach corners strategically
2. Use wall as reference point
3. Perform 90-degree turns precisely
4. Exit toward open space
5. Requires timing and familiarity

#### The Wall Hug
1. Keep 2-3 segments from wall
2. Move parallel to boundaries
3. Use wall as navigation aid
4. Exit when safe zone appears
5. Advanced control technique

### Level 10+ Survival

#### High-Speed Reflexes
- React within 100-150ms
- Anticipate 3-4 moves ahead
- Multiple simultaneous threats
- Micro-management of space

#### Pattern Recognition
- Predict food spawn zones
- Remember bonus locations
- Anticipate level difficulty spikes
- Learn game behavior patterns

#### Risk Assessment
1. **Safe Moves**: +10 points (low risk)
2. **Medium Moves**: +50 points (medium risk)
3. **High Moves**: +200 points (high risk)
4. Adjust risk based on goal

### Score Optimization Formula

```
Optimal Score = (Regular Food × 10 × Level) + 
                (Bonus Food × 50 × Level) + 
                (Level Bonus × Length Bonus)

Example at Level 8:
- 40 regular foods: 40 × 10 × 8 = 3,200 pts
- 6 bonus foods: 6 × 50 × 8 = 2,400 pts
- Total: 5,600 points
```

### Session Planning

#### 30-Minute Play Session
- Warm-up (5 min): Levels 1-3
- Build Length (10 min): Levels 4-6
- Collect Bonuses (10 min): Levels 6-8
- Push Limits (5 min): Levels 8+

#### 60-Minute Marathon
- Warm-up (5 min): Casual play
- Build Score (30 min): Steady progression
- Bonus Hunting (15 min): Aggressive collecting
- Final Push (10 min): Maximum difficulty
