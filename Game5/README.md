# Flappy Bird Pro

Welcome to Flappy Bird Pro, a modern take on the classic Flappy Bird game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## How to Play

1.  **Start the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button on the start screen.

3.  **Avoid Pipes**: Navigate your bird through the gaps in the pipes. 
4.  **Score Points**: Each pair of pipes you successfully pass earns you one point.
